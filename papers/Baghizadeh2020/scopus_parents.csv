None of the reviews had the explicit instructions described above. In addition, the first review was botched when the ineffective change of project manager was conducted in parallel with the review. The second review did stir emotions and raise concerns in the steering committee, but members let themselves be temporarily appeased by the project manager's assurances of better times ahead.
