Channel management was added to include the ability of the enterprise to support a direct electronic connection to the customer via a variety of channels. The set of 70 services was validated in interviews with more than 50 businesses over a period of five years; For two excellent discussions of information technology architecture, see P.G.W.

We did not assess the success of those initiatives but rather whether the enterprise could implement the initiatives given the infrastructure; Broadbent, Management by Maxim, pp. 77-92; A.M.

Vitale, Place to Space: Migrating to E-Business Models (Boston: Harvard Business School Press, 2001); To identify the infrastructure capability required we correlated the ability for the enterprise to implement a set of IT enabled initiatives with their pattern of infrastructure capability. Statistically significant positive correlations (i.e, 5% or less likelihood to be caused by chance) indicate the above industry average IT infrastructure capabilities that were present in enterprises that led in their ability to implement a particular type of IT enabled initiative see Infrastructure Competencies for Types of Business Initiatives; A word of caution: We based our analysis on ten years of research on top-performing companies and offer probably the best available data, but using the past to predict the future always has risks. One risk is that newer technologies will radically change the dynamics. Nevertheless, we think people often overestimate the speed of introduction and impact of new technologies (look at e-business, wireless, EDI, ERPs, CRM) in large enterprises. Large enterprises usually introduce new technologies in small amounts each year rather than make radical changes. There are at least three reasons: They can't absorb change any faster; the new technologies are risky and often fail to have the desired impact; the enterprise has to link the new technology with each tentacle of its legacy systems; Amram, M., Kulatilaka, N., (1998) Real Options, , New York: Oxford University Press",Article,Scopus
